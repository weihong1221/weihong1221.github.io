    <h1> Pang Wei Hong</h1>
    <h2>It always seems impossible until it's done</h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Pang Wei Hong, you can call me Wei Hong. I am 20 years old this year and I come from Malaysia.
        I am currently studying in Dasein Academy, majoring in Digital Media. I have a passion for coding and I love to
        learn new programming languages.
    </p>
    <p> In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and watching
        movies. I also like to travel and explore new places. My dream is to become a successful software engineer and
        contribute to the development of innovative technologies that can make a positive impact on people's lives.
        Thank you for taking the time to read my self-introduction!</p>
